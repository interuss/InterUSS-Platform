# New Go Implementation of the Remote ID portion of the DSS.

## Notes:
This code sets up an HTTP -> gRPC gateway, and a gRPC backend that will connect to CockroachDB.

### dss_v1
This is all generated!
1. The .proto file is generated from the Swagger spec (with modifications) using openapi2proto https://github.com/nytimes/openapi2proto
  a. 'components/schemas' needs to be changed to 'definitions'
  b. I removed all of the non-RID components
  c. Made a lot of modifications to the protos, which didn't play nicely with 'anyof'
  d. Renamed PositionReportingEntity to UASReporter. There's some discussion to change the name, UASReporter definitely won't stick around.
1. The rest of the files are generated using grpc-gateway https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway. Normally this generates 2 files, but I split out the client, and proto definitions from the actual grpc backend as well.

### Other Caveats
1. Go's package management and project structure is significantly different at Google. This is my first foray in Go outside of Google, and I'm not sure the best package structure to use that plays nice with go's import system. Modules seem like a cool new thing here.
1. Both the HTTP Proxy and the gRPC backend are built from the same binary, with a flag to control which mode it runs in. We may want to split this out at some point.
