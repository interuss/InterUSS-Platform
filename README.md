# USS to USS Communication and Synchronization Wrapper

This repository contains a simple and open API used for separate UAS Service
Suppliers (USS) to communicate during UAS operations, known as a Discovery and
Synchronization Service (DSS) as described in the ASTM remote ID standard.
This flexible and distributed system is used to connect multiple USSs
operating in the same general area to share information while protecting
operator and consumer privacy. The system is focused on facilitating
communication amongst actively operating USSs with no details about UAS
operations stored or processed in the DSS.


## Architecture


See the [API specification here](https://tiny.cc/dssapi_rid)

### HTTP Frontend

Serves as an Https gateway to the business logic, translating between Http Request
and gRPC to allow users to communicate to the DSS via simple Https calls. This
code is currently generated via
[grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway), and does not do
much other than translation.

### gRPC Backend


Component responsible for all the business logic as well as authentication. This
backend talks directly to CockroachDB.


### CockroachDB (CRDB)

Individual CockRoach DB instances hosting sharded data. More information about 
CockRoachDB 
[here](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/architecture/overview.html).

## Directories of Interest:
*   `config/` has all of the configuration required to deploy a DSS instance
    (typically to a kubernetes cluster). The README in that directory contains
    more information.
*   `pkg/` contains all of the source code for the DSS. See the README in that
    directory for more information.
*   `cmds/` contains entry points and docker files for the actual binaries (the
    `http-gateway` and `grpc-backend`)

## Notes

*   Currently this branch only supports the Remote ID API's. 
*   The current implementation relies on CockroachDB for data storage and
    synchronization between DSS participants. It is recommended to read up on 
    CockroachDB for performance characteristics and operational caveats. We list
    some of the caveats that we've run into below:

### CockroachDB Notes
*   CockroachDB (CRDB) currently uses certificates to authenticate clients and
    node to node communication. All of Node certs, client certs, and even a CA
    cert are all generated through the cockroach cli. The CA certs must be
    custom generated since the Node certs are require to have CN=node, which no
    public CA will sign.
*   CockroachDB allows public CA certs to be concatenated, to allow for
    certificate rotation. We abuse this to allow each DSS participant to bring
    their own CA cert.
*   CockroachDB nodes join the cluster virally. That is, each node keeps state
    on all the other nodes, and if a node connects to a new node, it will learn
    about the entire cluster through a gossip protocol.
*   Each CRDB node must be uniquely addressable and routable.
    *   Because of this, we expect each node to have it's own static IP and/or
    publicly resolvable hostname. In the future, we likely want to explore the
    use of service mesh frameworks.
*   CRDB splits up data based on the locality string. Data replication strategy
    is a database variable. The CRDB nodes will traverse the key,values of the
    locality flag to determine how to divy up the replicas. This means there
    could be more than 7 participants of the DSS, with only 3 or 5 (or 7)
    replicas, and each participant would simply receive a shard of a single
    replica.
*   CRDB clients talk to any CRDB node which will proxy traffic to the correct
    node(s).
*   There is an admin UI for CRDB (default port 8080). This should be locked
    down to internal traffic only.
*   The cluster init command must *only* ever be run against one node in the
    cluster. It seeds the data directories, and if it is run against another
    node it won't be able to join the cluster, or will create some splits within
    the cluster. The command is not dangerous once a node has joined a cluster
    that has been initiated, but it is possible a node's data directory gets
    destroyed so it should be avoided.
