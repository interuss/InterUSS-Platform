      description: >-
        Authorization from, or on behalf of, an authorization authority.  This
        authority will issue access tokens that are JSON Web Tokens as defined
        in RFC 7519, using the `RS256` algorithm for the signature, publish to
        all providers the public key for verifying that signature, and implement
        standard OAuth server discovery mechanisms as described in RFC 8414.
        The following fields must be included in the JWT claim for access tokens
        issued by this authority:
        * `iss`, with the URL at which the token generation request was
        received.
        * `exp`, with a time no further than 1 hour in the future.
        * `sub`, with unique ID of the client requesting the access token.
        * `scope`, with a string composed of a space-separated list of strings
        indicating the scopes granted, per RFC 6749.
        * `jti`, according to RFC 7519.
        Following the principle of least privilege, only one of the scopes
        enumerated in this document should be granted in a single token (though
        other scopes may accompany it).  The tokens granted by this authority
        must protect against reuse of received tokens to impersonate the sender
        to other recipients (via use of the `aud` claim or other means).
        When using the `aud` claim to protect against the reuse of received
        tokens, and absent guidance on behalf of the competent authority to the
        contrary, the JWT `aud` claim requested by the client must be included
        in each access token and must contain the fully qualified domain name of
        the URL the access token will be used to access.  For example, if a USS
        were querying the endpoint at
        https://dss.example.com:8888/rid/v2/dss/identification_service_areas,
        the access token included in the request should specify `"aud":
        "dss.example.com"`.
        Clients must provide these access tokens in an `Authorization` header in
        the form `Bearer <token>` in accordance with RFC 6750.
