# Definition for Docker image that runs a complete data node containing both an InterUSS Platform
# storage API server and an associated Zookeeper instance.

# THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE.

# Required environment variables:
#   ZOO_MY_ID: Integer index for this data node among the data node network.
#   ZOO_SERVERS: List data node servers on the network.  The address of this node's server should be
#     set to 0.0.0.0.
#     Ex: server.1=0.0.0.0:2888:3888 server.2=zoo2:2888:3888 server.3=zoo3:2888:3888
#   INTERUSS_API_PORT: Port number on which to provide the InterUSS Platform data node API.
#   INTERUSS_PUBLIC_KEY: Public key for InterUSS Platform OAuth.

# To build an image from this Dockerfile:
# 1) docker image build -f Dockerfile_datanode -t uss_datanode
# 2) docker run -it --privileged uss_datanode sh
# 2a) nohup dockerd & docker pull interussplatform/storage_api && docker pull zookeeper && \
#         killall dockerd && rm nohup.out
# 2b) exit
# 3) docker container ls -n 1
# 4) docker commit <container name> uss_datanode
